<h3><b><i> Polymorphism </i></b></h3>
In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A real-life example of polymorphism, a person at the same time can have different characteristics. Like a man at the same time is a father, a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming.
In C++ polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:
<ul>
<li>Compile time Polymorphism</li>
<li>Runtime Polymorphism</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-center display-6">
<h3><b><i> 1.Compile time Polymorphism </i></b></h3>
This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.
<ul>
  <li>
    Function Overloading: When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by change in number of arguments or/and change in type of arguments.
  </li>
  <li>
    Operator Overloading: When there are multiple operators with same name but different parameters then these operators are said to be overloaded. Operators can be overloaded by change in number of arguments or/and change in type of arguments.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class="text-center display-6">
<h3><b><i> 1.Runtime Polymorphism</i></b></h3>
This type of polymorphism is achieved by virtual functions.
<ul>
  <li>
Function overriding on the other hand occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
  </li>
  <li>
    Virtual functions are functions that can be redefined in derived classes.
  </li>
</ul>

#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class derived:public base
{
public:
    void print () //print () is already virtual function in derived class, we could also declared as virtual void print () explicitly
    { cout<< "print derived class" << endl; }

    void show ()
    { cout<< "show derived class" << endl; }
};

//main function
int main()
{
    base *bptr;
    derived d;
    bptr = &d;

    //virtual function, binded at runtime (Runtime polymorphism)
    bptr->print();

    // Non-virtual function, binded at compile time
    bptr->show();

    return 0;
